# Instructions for OVERWRITING an existing GitHub repository (shaownak.github.io)

## Step 1: Check your current Git status
# You already have Git initialized (on the master branch)

## Step 2: Check if you have a remote repository configured
git remote -v

## Step 3: Remote is already correctly configured! 
# Your remote is already set to: https://github.com/shaownak/shaownak.github.io.git

## Step 4: Stage and commit any new changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated portfolio website"

## Step 4: Force push to overwrite the remote repository
# Since you're on the master branch:
git push -f origin master

# WARNING: This will completely replace the remote repository contents with your local files.
# Any files that exist only on GitHub will be deleted.

## Optional: If you have issues with authentication
# GitHub now uses personal access tokens instead of passwords for HTTPS authentication
# 1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
# 2. Give it a name, set expiration, and check the "repo" scope
# 3. Copy the token and use it instead of your password when prompted

## Step 7: Verify your site is published
After pushing, wait a few minutes and then visit https://shaownak.github.io
