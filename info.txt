Academic Thesis and Research
Point-Cloud-based 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Navigation in Unmanned Ground Vehicles
May 2023 – October 2024
• Our research focuses on improving 3D object detection for autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) by
addressing the limitations of traditional 2D detection methods. We propose a two-stage pipeline that leverages point
cloud data to generate 3D object proposals, followed by a fusion of GLENetVR and SE-SSD architectures for accurate
detection. This hybrid approach enhances spatial understanding, improving object distinction and recognition in complex
environments. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, our model demonstrates superior accuracy,
surpassing both standalone SE-SSD and GLENetVR models, contributing to safer and more reliable UGV navigation.
