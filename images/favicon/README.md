# Creating and Using a Custom Favicon

I've added a favicon (the "S" icon that appears in the browser tab) to your website using an inline base64-encoded PNG image in the HTML file. This approach works well and doesn't require any additional files.

## If you want to customize the favicon:

1. **Option 1: Keep using the inline base64 approach**
   - Go to a base64 image converter online (search for "image to base64 converter")
   - Upload your custom icon image (should be square, ideally 32x32px or 64x64px)
   - Copy the base64 string it generates
   - Replace the long base64 string in your HTML file's favicon link tag

2. **Option 2: Use actual image files**
   - Create a proper .ico file using an image editor or favicon generator website
   - Replace the inline favicon link in index.html with:
     ```html
     <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
     <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
     ```
   - Put your favicon.ico file in the images/favicon directory

## Recommended Online Favicon Generators:
- favicon.io
- realfavicongenerator.net
- favicon-generator.org

These sites will let you upload an image or create a simple text-based icon (like the "S") and will generate all the necessary files and HTML code.

## What I've Provided:
- A base64-encoded PNG favicon already implemented in your HTML
- Example HTML files in the images/favicon directory showing how to create an S-based icon
- A placeholder favicon.ico file (this isn't a real .ico file, just a placeholder)
